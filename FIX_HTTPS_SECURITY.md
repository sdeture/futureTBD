# Fixing the "Not Secure" Warning on futuretbd.ai

## Why This Happens
GitHub Pages automatically provides free SSL certificates for custom domains, but it takes a little time (usually 15-60 minutes) after DNS setup.

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Go to GitHub Settings
- Go to: https://github.com/sdeture/futureTBD/settings/pages
- (Or manually: Your repo → Settings → Pages on the left sidebar)

### 2. Look for the Custom Domain Section
You should see:
- Custom domain: `futuretbd.ai` ✓
- There should be a checkbox that says **"Enforce HTTPS"**

### 3. Two Possible Scenarios:

#### Scenario A: "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox is AVAILABLE
- ✅ **Check the box!**
- Click Save if there's a save button
- Wait 5-10 minutes
- Visit https://futuretbd.ai (with the 's')
- The warning should be gone!

#### Scenario B: "Enforce HTTPS" is GRAYED OUT or says "Not yet available"
- This means GitHub is still setting up your certificate
- You'll see a message like "HTTPS is being provisioned" or "Certificate not yet created"
- **Just wait!** - Usually takes 15-60 minutes
- Keep refreshing the settings page every 10 minutes
- Once the checkbox becomes clickable, check it!

### 4. Force HTTPS in Your Browser
While waiting, try going directly to:
- https://futuretbd.ai (note the 's' in https)
- Instead of http://futuretbd.ai

## How to Know It's Working:
- ✅ The padlock icon appears in your browser
- ✅ No more "Not Secure" warning
- ✅ URL shows https:// (with the 's')
- ✅ In GitHub settings, "Enforce HTTPS" is checked

## Timeline:
- **0-15 minutes**: GitHub detects your custom domain
- **15-60 minutes**: GitHub provisions SSL certificate
- **After 1 hour**: Should definitely be working
- **Maximum wait**: Very rarely takes up to 24 hours

## If It's Still Not Working After an Hour:

1. **Try removing and re-adding the domain in GitHub:**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Delete the text in "Custom domain"
   - Save
   - Add `futuretbd.ai` back
   - Save again

2. **Check your DNS records are correct:**
   - The 4 A records should all be there
   - Sometimes one might not have saved properly

3. **Clear your browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (PC)

## The Good News:
- This is completely normal!
- It's a one-time setup thing
- Once it works, it's permanent
- GitHub's SSL certificates are free and auto-renew forever
