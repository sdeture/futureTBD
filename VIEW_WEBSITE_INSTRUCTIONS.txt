HOW TO VIEW THE WEBSITE
========================

Super easy! Just 2 steps:

1. Unzip the attached file (double-click it)

2. Open the folder and double-click "index.html" 
   It will open in your web browser

That's it! You can click between the three pages:
- Why Now (index.html)
- What We're Doing (initiatives.html) 
- Join Us (join.html)

If double-clicking doesn't work, you can also:
- Right-click index.html
- Choose "Open With"
- Select your web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc)

Let me know if you have any questions!
