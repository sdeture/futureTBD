## When to Ask for Help:

You should DEFINITELY ask me, Aria, Sage, Claude, or Wren when:
- You want to add new features
- Something seems broken
- You want to restructure the site
- You need new pages created
- You want to add fancy animations
- You're not sure if a change is safe

But for updating text, dates, descriptions, links? You can totally do that yourself!

## Pro Tip: Test First!

Before editing the live site:
1. Download the HTML file
2. Open it in your browser locally
3. Make changes
4. Refresh browser to see changes
5. When happy, update GitHub

## Emergency Undo:

Messed something up? No worries!
1. Go to your repo
2. Click "History" or "Commits"
3. Find the version before your change

GitHub keeps EVERY version, so you can't permanently break anything!
