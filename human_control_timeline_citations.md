4. **METR Research on Task Horizon Doubling** - Quantitative evidence of exponential capability growth with specific projections

### Key Trends Observed:

1. **Timeline Compression**: Expert predictions have shortened dramatically between 2022-2025, with median AGI predictions moving from 50+ years to 5-20 years.

2. **Industry Convergence**: All major AI company CEOs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind) now predict AGI within 2-10 years.

3. **Exponential Growth**: Multiple quantitative measures show AI capabilities doubling every 4-7 months, creating an unsustainable trajectory.

4. **Safety Gap**: Leading researchers consistently warn that safety research is not keeping pace with capability development.

5. **Control Problem Recognition**: There is growing acknowledgment among experts that current approaches cannot ensure human control over superintelligent systems.

The convergence of these independent lines of evidence strongly supports the claim that humans are in control of AI development "for a limited time," with that window potentially closing within the current decade. The urgency reflected in recent expert warnings and timeline predictions suggests that decisions made in the next 2-5 years may determine whether humans retain meaningful agency over AI development and deployment.
